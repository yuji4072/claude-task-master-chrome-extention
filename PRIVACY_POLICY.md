# Privacy Policy for Claude TaskMaster for GitHub

**Effective Date:** October 26, 2023

This Privacy Policy describes how "Claude TaskMaster for GitHub" (the "Extension") handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## 1. Information We Collect

Our Extension is designed to work locally within your browser. We do not have any servers, and we do not collect or transmit any personal data to third parties. The data the Extension handles includes:

*   **Website Content:** The Extension reads the content of the `.task.json` file located within the GitHub repository you are currently viewing. This is essential to display your tasks.
*   **User Activity:** The Extension responds to your clicks on the UI elements it creates (e.g., the "Tasks" tab, filter buttons, sort controls). This activity is processed locally to update the view and is not logged or transmitted.
*   **User Settings:** The Extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to save your preferences, such as the cache duration. This data is stored in your browser and synced across your devices via your Google account.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

The data handled by the Extension is used exclusively for its core functionality:

*   To parse the `.task.json` file and render it as a visual task list within the GitHub interface.
*   To respond to your interactions with the UI (e.g., sorting or filtering the task list).
*   To save and apply your settings.

**Crucially, all data processing occurs locally on your computer. We do not send your task data, repository information, or any other user data to any external server.**

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share any user data with any third parties because we do not collect or store it.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
