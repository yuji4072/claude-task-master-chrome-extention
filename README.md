# claude-task-master-chrome-extension

`claude-task-master-chrome-extension` is a Chrome extension designed to work with [claude-task-master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master), an AI-powered task management system.

It enhances team visibility by displaying the `tasks.json` file generated by `claude-task-master` directly on your GitHub repository page.

## Workflow

1.  **Manage Tasks:** Use `claude-task-master` in your terminal or editor to generate and manage your `tasks.json` file.
2.  **Commit & Push:** Push the updated `tasks.json` to your GitHub repository.
3.  **Visualize Tasks:** The `claude-task-master-chrome-extension` automatically reads the `tasks.json` file, adding a "Tasks" tab to your GitHub page to display the task list.

## Features

- **Integration with claude-task-master:** Dynamically loads the `tasks.json` file generated by `claude-task-master` from your repository's main branch.
- **Seamless GitHub UI:** Adds a "Tasks" tab to the GitHub repository navigation, allowing you to view tasks without leaving the page.
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Easily filter tasks by status or priority, and sort them by ID or priority.
- **Configurable Cache:** Set the cache duration from the extension's popup settings.
- **High Performance:** Built with virtual scrolling to smoothly handle large task lists.
